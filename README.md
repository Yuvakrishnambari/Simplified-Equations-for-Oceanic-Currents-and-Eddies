## Simplified Equations for Oceanic Currents and Eddies

MSc Thesis – Data Science & Statistical Learning

This repository contains the materials for my Master’s thesis, which focuses on the mathematical and computational modelling of oceanic currents and eddies using simplified governing equations derived from geophysical fluid dynamics.

The work combines theoretical analysis, mathematical modelling, and computational reasoning to study the dynamic stability and behavior of large-scale ocean flows.

## Thesis Overview

Oceanic currents and mesoscale eddies play a critical role in global climate, heat transport, and marine ecosystems.
However, the full governing equations of fluid motion are often too complex to analyze directly.

Objective

The primary goal of this thesis is to:

Derive simplified dynamical equations for oceanic currents and eddies

Analyze their stability and behavior

Study how scaling, non-dimensionalisation, and physical assumptions influence flow dynamics

This work bridges applied mathematics, physics, and data-driven reasoning, and demonstrates strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
